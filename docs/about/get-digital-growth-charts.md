# Get Digital Growth Charts

## Paper growth charts holding up your digital transformation?

We know from talking to experienced child health clinicians that they absolutely **must have** growth charts in any new digital solution. The lack of good quality digital charts on the market has really held back digital transformation in many care settings. Some settings were forced to either hold up plans for digitisation, or use a parallel paper chart workflow.

We built the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts project to be a cost-effective, safe solution to that problem.

## Trusted, beautiful Digital Growth Charts

Produced and warranted by the RCPCH itself, the international authority on child health. Designed to be familiar to clinicians used to the old paper growth charts. And also richly functional, adding features like automatic gestational age correction, bone age, midparental height, event recording, and specialist references for Turner and Down syndromes.

## The heavy lifting is done for you.

We know that calculation and display of growth parameters is technically hard, and comes with many clinical caveats. Our SssS (Software As A Service) platform does all the hard work for you, meaning your clinicians get dependable, trustworthy charts, and digital transformation can proceed.

We think more stuff in the NHS should be done this way!

## Who's using the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts?

Already in use in numerous NHS Trusts across England, the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts are also currently being implemented in UK General Practice clinical systems, at National level in Wales, and within a major neonatal and maternity system.
